This is an implementation of the NAT64 mechanism as described in the RFC6146.
It's being implemented as a Netfilter target module.

module dependencies (modprobe): ipv6, ip_tables, nf_conntrack, nf_conntrack_ipv4

Directories:
	/mod : includes the kernel module' source code and respective Makefile.
	/usr : include the iptables module (userspace interface).
	/include : includes the header files used.

In ubuntu, you will require the following packages: iptables-dev, libssl-dev
Also, it may sound obvious, but make sure you have both the image and the headers 
of the kernel updated to the 2.6.38 version, at least.
