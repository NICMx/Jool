/**
 * @file
 * Random packet-related functions.
 *
 * You might want to be aware of the different types of packets the kernel can
 * throw at Jool; see below.
 *
 * (Note that when I say "fragment" I mean "IP fragment". "Page fragments" are
 * something else altogether and are somewhat transparent to Jool. All the
 * variations below can be paged, except for subsequent packets already
 * represented as pages.)
 *
 * 1. A "real full packet" is a packet that is not fragmented. It is a single
 *    skb with fragment offset = 0 and MF = 0.
 * 2. A "fake full packet" is a packet which is fragmented but the kernel API
 *    wants us to believe otherwise.
 *    These are "assembled" skbs in that the skb points to the first fragment
 *    and the remaining fragments are queued in skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list.
 *    Though many kernel functions want us to believe the skb is a real full
 *    packet, and ideally we would follow suit, doing surgery on individual
 *    fragments is sometimes necessary evil for PMTU reasons.
 *
 * (A "full packet" is either a real full packet or a fake full packet.)
 *
 * 3. A "fragmented packet" is a normal fragmented packet that hasn't suffered
 *    defrag alterations.
 *    In other words, fragment offset > 0 and/or MF == true, shinfo->frag_list
 *    isn't populated and the skb is not queued in any other packet's frag_list.
 *    These are fragments but are separated from their ilk during translation as
 *    you would expect from a stateless forwarding machine.
 * 4. An "internal packet" is a packet wrapped as payload in an ICMP error.
 *    These are set up and used by the RFC6145 submodule.
 *    Internal packets can be truncated! Header lengths might contradict the
 *    sizes from the skb fields. Jool in general should *rarely* rely on header
 *    lengths.
 *    I repeat: Because of internal packets, JOOL IN GENERAL SHOULD RARELY RELY
 *    ON HEADER LENGTHS!
 * 5. A "subsequent packet" is a fragment that has been queued in some fake full
 *    packet's frag_list. These packets are special in that they have stripped
 *    (deleted) l3 headers for no apparent reason.
 *    As I understand it, while forwarding, the kernel regenerates "subsequent
 *    headers" from scratch so any special differences between the original
 *    headers are lost. Ever since the atomic fragment hack was removed from the
 *    xlat standards this is no longer harmful so we don't mind it anymore.
 *    So yeah, do not translate subsequent headers. They do not exist.
 *    Another thing worth mentioning is that some kernels are even more insane
 *    in that they queue subsequent fragments in ->frags instead of ->frag_list.
 *    This is, in fact, also not entirely harmful because we can simply transfer
 *    pages as they are and the kernel should automatically turn them into
 *    fragments if they won't fit through the MTU. I don't think this is as
 *    deterministic as it should be, since the kernel might not be aware of the
 *    path MTU (and therefore linearize fragment pages), but there is nothing
 *    else we can do because there is nothing that will tell us whether a
 *    ->frags member is a fragment or a page.
 *
 * TODO copy pages "as they are". We're currently linearizing them...
 *
 * For the most part, full/fragmented/internal packets can be handled similarly.
 * Subsequent packets, freaks of nature as they are, are thankfully often
 * transparent to us.
