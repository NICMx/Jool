# Contact

Probably prefer [Github issues]({{ site.repository-url }}/issues) for bug tracking, feature requests and help. Github can also send you notifications on releases if you watch the project.

Otherwise, we have the following mailing lists:

- jool-list@nic.mx ([Registration](https://mail-lists.nic.mx/listas/listinfo/jool-list)): General public discussion and news. Questions, requests and comments welcomed.
- jool-news@nic.mx ([Registration](https://mail-lists.nic.mx/listas/listinfo/jool-news)): To advertise new releases. Only the dev team can place mails here.
- [jool@nic.mx](mailto:jool@nic.mx): A mail alias you can use to reach us developers only.
