# Contact

- jool-list@nic.mx is a mail list intended for general public discussion and news. Questions, requests and comments welcomed.  
  A misplaced security gimmic currently prevents the archives from being public, but they are actually being built and will become available as soon as the TODO reaches one of our admins.  
  You can register to this list [here](https://mail-lists.nic.mx/listas/listinfo/jool-list).
- jool-news@nic.mx is a mail list intended to inform news to its recipients. At this point, it is only used to signal new releases being published at this site.  
  Anyone can listen, but only the dev team can place mails here, so you don't have to worry about spam.  
  You can register to this list [here](https://mail-lists.nic.mx/listas/listinfo/jool-list).  
  Because of its purpose, this list rarely sees more than one e-mail a month.
- [jool@nic.mx](mailto:jool@nic.mx) is a mail alias you can use to reach us developers only.  
  Though we're willing to provide advice via this medium, we'd be grateful is you used jool-list@nic.mx for this purpose instead so a future archive surfer can benefit from the experience.
- Our official bug tracker is the [Github corner](https://github.com/NICMx/NAT64/issues). This is also a good place to request features.
